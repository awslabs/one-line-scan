The basic functionality of the one line cr bot is described in the [doc/README.md](https://github.com/awslabs/one-line-scan/blob/master/doc/README.md)
file. Examples to use the file are given in the [doc/EXAMPLES.md](https://github.com/awslabs/one-line-scan/blob/master/doc/EXAMPLES.md) file. This file
highlights using one-line-cr-bot.sh as part of CI systems.

# Workflows

There are workflows that allow to automate analysis, and also block. The below
YAML file can be used as an example to start implementing code analysis for your
C and C++ projects using github workflows.

## Github Workflows

Github workflows are activated by placing a YAML file in the .github/workflows
directory. By placing the below file into that directory, i.e. storing the full
below content in the file .github/workflows/one-line-cr-bot.yml any future pull
request will receive code analysis.

The file has sections labeled "[ACTION REQUIRED]" which likely need to be
adapted to meet the configuration of your project.

The given setup only comments to your PR communication, but does not stop block
your PR. To be able to achieve this, the workflow has to be run as type
pull_request_target, which has permissions to add comments.

    # This workflow will present introduced defects of a pull request to a given
    # branch of a package.
    #
    # The workflow has locations labeled '[ACTION REQUIRED]' where adaptation for
    # your build might be required, as well as where to compare the findings to.
    #
    # To learn more about the available options, check the CLI parameters of the
    # script 'one-line-cr-bot.sh' in https://github.com/awslabs/one-line-scan.git

Configurations similar to the above are already used in github projects, e.g. [KTF](https://github.com/awslabs/ktf/blob/mainline/.github/workflows/one-line-cr-bot.yml).
